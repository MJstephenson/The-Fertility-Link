#The Fertility Link

##Project Overview

The Fertility Link project allows individuals and couples in the UK who are considering, starting, going through or have concluded their fertility treatment/s to connect with each other for peer support through the medium of chatrooms and 1-1 video conferencing. There is also the option for a premium subscription service that gives access to professional support from health care professionals via webinars, Q and A sessions, information libraries, chatrooms, 1-1 video conferencing and virtual reality. This service does not currently exist in the UK and there is a distinct lack of accessible peer/professional support or a dedicated website for those going through their fertility journey so the project offers a solution to this need.

## Design

### Design Choices
The website will be visited by all genders whether as individuals or couples and therefore provides a good balance between masculinity and femininity in the image and colour choices. The website design is developed so that it showcases the benefits and services of signing up to the premium subscription and steers new users towards the signup page. 
The link logo in the header was used so that the site becomes instantly recognisable by the users.

### Colour
For the site the colours pink and blue are selected to represent the desire for a birth of a boy or girl from the potential subscribers to elicit a positive emotion.
Black is selected within the web pages to make images and text pop and be visually appealing. This was influenced by https://www.awwwards.com/sites/de-fortuyne which is a nominee for the awwwards website for web design. 
A soft/light grey was selected to offset the black and to allow a sharp contrasting black font to be utilised.
White is used for the logo to give it a high contrast.
Colormind was used for the colour selection.


### Fonts
Google fonts has been imported and "I HAVE NOT DECIEDED WHICH FONT TO USE YET – POSSIBLY ROBERTO" has been used for all the text inside the website with sans-serif selected for if a browser does not support the prior font.

### Structure
The page is structured in a user friendly, easily recognised, simple format. The first time user sees a typical navigation bar at the top of the page, with a sign in button to the left and a navigation bar to the right.
